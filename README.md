#### Restaurant Reviews App – Stage 1

## Description

This is a simple app that allows user to see a list of pre-selected restaurants located in Lower Manhattan. The app also displays location of all restaurants in an interactive map and allows to see additional details of each restaurant: working hours, exact location on the map and comments.

Additional features:
*	App is fully responsive in all viewport sizes
*	Site can be accessed offline after the first visit
*	Site is accessible and can be used with assistive technology

### Launching the App

To launch the app on your machine, take the following steps:
1.	Copy the repository to your local machine using command: `$ git clone https://github.com/DovydasJanulaitis/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git`
2.	Open the cloned project folder and start a simple HTTP server on your machine to launch the app. To launch HTTP server, I recommend using Python that has simple tools to do this:
    - Download and install Python on your machine. You can download Python by clicking this link. If you already have Python, skip to the next step
    - Open the terminal and check which version of Python you have installed by running `$ python -V`
    - If you have Python 2.x start the server by typing `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. If you have Python 3.x, start the server by typing `python -m http.server 8000` (you don’t have to use port 8000, any other port works as well)
    - With your server running, open your default browser and visit ` http://localhost:8000`. You should see the app running
