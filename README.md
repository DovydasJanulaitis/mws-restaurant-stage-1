#### _ Restaurant Reviews App – Stage 1

## Description

This is a simple app that allows user to see a list of pre-selected restaurants located in Lower Manhattan. The app also displays location of all restaurants in an interactive map and allows to see additional details of each restaurant: working hours, exact location on the map and comments.

Additional features:
•	App is fully responsive in all viewport sizes
•	Site can be accessed offline after the first visit
•	Site is accessible and can be used with assistive technology

### Launching the App

To launch the app on your machine, take the following steps:
1.	Copy the repository to your local machine using command: `$ git clone https://github.com/DovydasJanulaitis/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git`
2.	Open the cloned project folder and start a simple HTTP server on your machine to launch the app. To launch HTTP server, I recommend using Python that has simple tools to do this:
a.	Download and install Python on your machine. You can download Python by clicking this link. If you already have Python, skip to the next step
b.	Open the terminal and check which version of Python you have installed by running `$ python -V`
c.	If you have Python 2.x start the server by typing `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. If you have Python 3.x, start the server by typing `python -m http.server 8000` (you don’t have to use port 8000, any other port works as well)
d.	With your server running, open your default browser and visit ` http://localhost:8000`. You should see the app running
